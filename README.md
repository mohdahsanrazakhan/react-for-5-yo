## What is React?

- React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications
- Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta)
- React is widely used to create interactive and dynamic web applications

### Here's a simplified breakdown: (optional)

- **Open-source** refers to software or projects where the original creators provide the underlying _code and resources for anyone to view, use, modify, and share freely_.<br>
  It's like sharing a recipe for a dish you've created, allowing others to see how it's made, make improvements, and share their versions without any restrictions. Open-source fosters collaboration and innovation by making knowledge and tools accessible to a wide community of people.

- **JavaScript library** is like a _collection of pre-written code_ that helps web developers do common tasks more easily and quickly when building websites or web applications.<br>
  It's like having a toolbox full of tools that you can use instead of having to create each tool from scratch.<br>
  These libraries provide ready-made functions and features, saving time and effort in coding, and making it easier to create interactive and dynamic websites.

- **User Interface (UI)** is like the _"face" of a computer program or a digital device_. It's what you see and interact with on your screen when you use software or apps.<br>
  UI design focuses on making this interaction as user-friendly and easy to understand as possible. It includes things like buttons, menus, icons, and how information is displayed, all aimed at making your experience pleasant and efficient when using technology.<br>
  Essentially, it's the bridge that allows you to communicate and control the digital world with your clicks, taps, and gestures.

- **Web Application** is like a _software program that you can use through a web browser_, just like how you use websites. It's a tool or service that helps you do things on the internet, like checking your email, shopping online, or using social media.<br>
  Unlike regular websites that mostly provide information, web applications allow you to interact with them, input data, and get specific results or perform tasks online, making them more like digital tools than just pages to read.

## React Installation

### Prerequisites:

Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. To check the version of Node.js run `node -v` or `node --version` and `npm -v` or `npm --version`. Don't worry about NPM, it installed with node.<br>
If you don't download it yet. Go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Commands for installing ReactJS using CRA:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project. <br>

## React Components

A React component is _a reusable, self-contained building block_ of a user interface in a React application. It represents _a part of the UI that can have its own logic, state, and rendering behavior_.<br>
React components are at the core of building web interfaces with React, and they can range from simple, isolated elements like buttons or form inputs to complex, nested structures like entire sections of a webpage.

### Here are key characteristics and concepts related to React components:

- **Reusability:** React _components are designed to be reusable_. You can create a component once and use it multiple times across your application. This promotes a modular and efficient approach to UI development.

- **Encapsulation:** Components _encapsulate both the UI and the logic related to that UI_. This encapsulation keeps the code _organized and maintains a separation of concerns_.

- **State:** Components can have their own _state_, which is a _data store that can change over time_. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect those changes in the UI.

- **Props (Properties):** _Components can receive data from their parent components through props_. Props are like parameters that allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of a component when you use it in different contexts.

- **Lifecycle Methods:** Components have a lifecycle, which consists of various methods that are automatically invoked at different stages of a component's existence. These methods allow you to perform actions such as initializing state, making API requests, or cleaning up resources.

- **Rendering:** refers to _the process of turning your React components into a user interface (UI)_ that users can see and interact with on a web page. It's like taking the blueprint (your React components) and actually building the house (the visible and interactive part of your website) based on that blueprint.<br>
  When you write React code, you create components that describe what your UI should look like and how it should behave. React then takes these components and renders them onto the web page, making them visible to users. This _rendering process involves updating the UI whenever there are changes in your data or when user interactions occur_.<br>
  So, rendering in React is _all about making your web application come to life by taking your code and displaying it_ as a functional and interactive user interface.

- **Hierarchy:** React components can be _organized into a hierarchy or tree structure, with parent components containing child components_. Changes to a parent component can affect its children, allowing for complex, interactive UIs.

- **Functional and Class Components:** React components can be _defined using either JavaScript classes (class components)_ or _JavaScript functions (functional components)_. Functional components are becoming more common, especially with the introduction of React Hooks.

- **Component Composition:** You can _compose more complex UIs by combining multiple smaller components_. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

- **Custom Components:** In addition to using built-in HTML elements like `div` and `span`, you can create custom components to represent parts of your UI that have specific functionality or styling.

## React JSX

JSX, which stands for **JavaScript XML**, is _a syntax extension for JavaScript_ often used with React. JSX _allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code_, making it easier to describe the structure and content of your user interfaces.

### Key features of JSX include:

- **HTML-Like Syntax:** JSX looks similar to HTML. You can use tags like `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` to define elements in your components.
- **Embedding Expressions:** can _embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces `{}`_. This allows you to include _dynamic data or logic directly_ in your JSX code.
- **Components:** JSX also _allows you to use React components just like HTML elements_. For example, if you have a custom `Button` component, you can use it in JSX as `<Button />`.

**Here's an example of JSX in a React component:**

```javascript
import React from "react";

function MyComponent(props) {
  const greeting = "Hello, React JSX!";
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{greeting}</h1>
      <p>This is an example of JSX in a React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

`<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` are JSX elements representing HTML tags.<br>
`{greeting}` is a JavaScript expression embedded within JSX, and it will be replaced with the value of the `greeting` variable.<br>
`MyComponent` is a React functional component.<br>
JSX is transpiled (converted) into regular JavaScript code by build tools like Babel before it's executed in the browser. This transpilation step is necessary because browsers don't understand JSX directly. The transformed JavaScript code is what actually creates and updates the DOM elements when the component is rendered.<br>

Overall, JSX simplifies the process of creating and maintaining React components by allowing you to express UI structures in a familiar, HTML-like syntax while still leveraging the power of JavaScript.

## React Props

In React, **props** is short for _properties_, and _it refers to a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component_. Props are a fundamental part of React's component architecture and are _used to make components dynamic and reusable_.

### Here are the key points to understand about React props:

- **Passing Data:** Props allow you to pass data (values or objects) from a parent component to a child component. This data can be used by the child component to customize its behavior or render dynamic content.

- **Immutable:** _Props are immutable_, which **means** that the _child component receiving props cannot modify them_. They are _read-only, ensuring that data flows in one direction, from parent to child_.

- **Functional and Class Components:** Props can be used with both functional components (using function arguments) and class components (accessed via this.props).

- **Accessing Props:** In a **functional component**, you can _access props as arguments to the component function_. In a **class component**, you _access props using `this.props`_.

- **Default Values:** You can specify default values for props, which will be used if the parent component doesn't provide a value for a particular prop.

- **Dynamic Rendering:** Props enable dynamic rendering by allowing you to conditionally render content based on the values of props.

Here's a simple example of how props work in React:

```javascript
// ParentComponent.js
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  const name = "Alice";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <ChildComponent name={name} />
    </>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

```javascript
// ChildComponent.js
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

In this example:

- `name` is a prop passed from ParentComponent to ChildComponent.
- In ChildComponent, `{props.name}` is used to access and render the value of the name prop.

By using props, you can _create reusable components_ that can be configured differently when used in various parts of your application. _Props are essential for building dynamic and data-driven user interfaces in React_.

## React State

In React, **state** is a _JavaScript object_ used _to store and manage data that can change over time and affect a component's behavior and rendering_. Each React component can have its own state, which is used to keep track of information that should be reactive to user interactions, data fetching, or other dynamic changes.

### Key points about React state:

- **Component-Specific:** _State is local to a component_. Each instance of a component maintains its own state, making it independent of other instances of the same component.

- **Initialization:** State is typically _initialized in a component's constructor or by using a React Hook (in functional components)_. For **class components**, you _set the initial state using `this.state` in the constructor_. In **functional components**, you use the _useState Hook to initialize state_.

- **Updating State:** State can be _updated using the setState method_ in class components or by calling the state updater function returned by the useState Hook in functional components. _React automatically re-renders the component when state is updated_.

- **Immutable:** State should be treated as immutable. You should _not directly modify state_; instead, _use setState (for class components)_ or provide a _new state object (for functional components)_ when updating state.

- **Asynchronous Updates:** State updates are asynchronous in React. This means that _React batches multiple state updates together for performance reasons_. If you need to perform actions after a state update, _use a callback function provided to setState or the useState Hook_.

- **Local Scope:** State is _accessible only within the component where it is defined_. It cannot be directly accessed or modified by parent or sibling components. _If you need to share state between components, you can lift the state up to a **common ancestor component** and pass it down as props_.

**Rendering Based on State:** React components typically render based on the values stored in their state. _When state changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect those changes in the user interface_.

Here's a simple example of how state is used in a React **class component**:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the `count` variable is stored in the component's state. When the **Increment** button is clicked, the `incrementCount` method is called, which updates the `count` state, causing the component to re-render with the new count value. State allows you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React applications.

Certainly! Here's the same counter example using a **functional component** and the _useState Hook_ in React:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this functional component:

- We import `useState` from the **\*react** library\* to manage the component's state.
- Inside the `Counter` component, we use the `useState` Hook to declare the `count` state variable and its corresponding updater function, `setCount`. We initialize `count` to `0`.
- When the **Increment** button is clicked, the `incrementCount` function is called, which updates the `count` state using `setCount`, just like `setState` in class components.
- The component renders the `count` value and the **Increment** button, and it automatically re-renders whenever `count` changes.

Functional components with Hooks offer a more concise and modern way to manage state in React applications.

## React Events

In React, events refer to actions or interactions that occur in the user interface, such as clicking a button, typing in an input field, or moving the mouse. React allows you to handle these events by attaching event listeners to elements in your components, just like you would in traditional web development.

### Here are the key points to understand about React events:

- **Event Handling:** React components can _define event handlers_, which _are JavaScript functions that get executed in response to specific events_. For example, you can define an `onClick` event handler to handle a button click.

- **Event Attributes:** In JSX, you can _attach event handlers to elements using special attributes named after the event_, such as `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onChange`, etc. These attributes take a _reference to a function that will be called when the event occurs_.

- **Event Object:** React passes an event object as the first argument to event handler functions. This _object contains information about the event_, such as the _target element, mouse coordinates, key codes, and more_.

- **Binding Event Handlers:** When defining event handlers in **class components**, you often _need to manually bind them to the component instance using `.bind()` or arrow functions_. In **functional components**, this is _not necessary when using the function syntax_.

- **Event Propagation:** React follows the same event propagation model as the browser's native events. Events bubble up from child to parent components, and you can stop propagation or prevent the default behavior of events as needed.

- **Synthetic Events:** React provides a _synthetic event system that normalizes browser-specific event behavior_, ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers.

Here's an example of handling a click event in a React component:

```javascript
import React from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
    // You can access event properties like event.target, event.clientX, etc.
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

- We define a `handleClick` function to be executed when the button is clicked.
- We attach the `handleClick` function to the button's `onClick` event attribute.
  When the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called, and it shows an alert.

React events provide a way to create interactive and responsive user interfaces by allowing you to respond to user interactions with your application.

## Styling in React

Styling refers to _the process of defining how your components and their elements should appear visually_. Styling in React can be accomplished using various approaches and techniques, and it plays a crucial role in determining the look and feel of your user interface.

### Here are some common ways to apply styling in React:

- **Inline Styles:** You can use the `style` attribute in JSX to apply inline CSS styles directly to individual elements. Inline styles are _defined as JavaScript objects where property names are **camelCased** versions of CSS property names_.

```jsx
const buttonStyle = {
  backgroundColor: "blue",
  color: "white",
  padding: "10px",
};

function MyComponent() {
  return <button style={buttonStyle}>Click me</button>;
}
```

- **CSS Modules:** CSS Modules are a way to _locally scope CSS styles_ by _importing CSS files into your JavaScript_ or TypeScript components. This approach prevents style conflicts and makes it easier to maintain styles for specific components.

```jsx
import styles from "./MyComponent.module.css";

function MyComponent() {
  return <button className={styles.button}>Click me</button>;
}
```

- **Styled-Components:** Styled-components is a popular library that allows you to _define component-specific styles using tagged template literals_. It encourages writing CSS directly within your JavaScript code.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

- **CSS-in-JS Libraries:** Other CSS-in-JS libraries, such as **Emotion** and **JSS**, _provide similar functionality to styled-components_, allowing you to _write CSS styles as JavaScript code_.

- **External CSS:** You can also use traditional external CSS files to define styles and then include them in your React application's HTML file. This approach is similar to standard web development.

- **CSS Preprocessors:** You can use CSS preprocessors like **Sass** or **Less** to _write more structured and maintainable styles_ and then compile them to regular CSS.

- **CSS Frameworks:** Many CSS frameworks, such as **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap** and **Material-UI**, offer _pre-designed components and styles_ that you can incorporate into your React application.

The _choice of styling method depends_ on your project's requirements, team preferences, and your familiarity with different approaches. _React provides flexibility in how you apply styles_, allowing you to _choose the best approach for your specific use case_.

## React Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React refers to _the ability to render different content or components based on certain conditions or criteria_. It allows you to control what is displayed in your user interface dynamically, depending on factors such as user input, the state of your application, or external data.

### Here are common techniques for conditional rendering in React:

**Using JavaScript Conditional Statements:**

You can use _standard JavaScript conditional statements_ like `if`, `else if`, and `else` within your JSX to conditionally render components or content. For example:

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  if (props.isLoggedIn) {
    return <p>Welcome, user!</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>Please log in to continue.</p>;
  }
}
```

**Ternary Operator:**

The ternary operator (`condition ? trueValue : falseValue`) is a concise way to conditionally render content. It's often used for simple conditional rendering:

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.isLoggedIn ? (
        <p>Welcome, user!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Please log in to continue.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Logical && Operator:**

You can use the `&&` operator to conditionally render content. When the expression on the left is truthy, the component on the right is rendered:

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.isLoggedIn && <p>Welcome, user!</p>}</div>;
}
```

**Switch Statements:**

For more complex conditional rendering scenarios, you can use `switch` statements in combination with functions or components:

```jsx
function renderContent(selectedTab) {
  switch (selectedTab) {
    case "tab1":
      return <Tab1Content />;
    case "tab2":
      return <Tab2Content />;
    default:
      return <DefaultContent />;
  }
}
```

**Mapping Over Data:**

When rendering lists of items, you can use `.map()` to conditionally render each item based on its properties or state.

```jsx
function renderItems(items) {
  return items.map((item) => (
    <div key={item.id}>{item.isVisible && <p>{item.name}</p>}</div>
  ));
}
```

_Conditional rendering is essential for building **dynamic** and **interactive** user interfaces in React_. It allows you to respond to user interactions and application state changes by showing or hiding specific content as needed.

## React Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a key concept in React.js, and it's a programming concept that improves the performance and efficiency of updating the user interface (UI) in web applications.

In simple words, the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) in React is like a copy of the real web page but exists in memory. When you make changes to a web page using React, it doesn't directly update the actual web page you see in your browser. Instead, React first makes changes to this virtual copy, which is much faster to work with because it's in memory, not on the actual webpage.

Once all the changes are made to the virtual DOM, React compares it to the real DOM to find the differences or updates. Then, it only applies these specific changes to the real web page, rather than updating the entire page. This process is much more efficient and helps make React applications fast and responsive.

In essence, the Virtual DOM is a clever optimization technique that React uses to update web pages efficiently, making your web applications feel smooth and responsive to user interactions.

### Here's how the Virtual DOM works:

- **Real DOM vs. Virtual DOM:**

  - **Real DOM:** The Real DOM is the actual browser representation of the web page's structure. It's a tree-like structure that consists of HTML elements (nodes). Manipulating the Real DOM can be slow and inefficient, especially when dealing with complex web applications with frequent updates.

  - **Virtual DOM:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy or representation of the Real DOM created and managed by React. It's a JavaScript object tree that mirrors the structure of the Real DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to keep track of changes and updates that need to be made to the UI.

- **Reconciliation Process:**

  When changes occur in a React application (e.g., user interactions, data updates), React doesn't immediately update the Real DOM. Instead, it follows these steps:

  - **Update the Virtual DOM:** React first updates the Virtual DOM to reflect the changes in the application's state or data.

  - **Diffing:** React then compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM (from the previous state) to determine the differences or changes that need to be made.

  - **Reconciliation:** React calculates the most efficient way to update the Real DOM based on the differences found during the diffing process. It creates a minimal set of changes (or patches) that are required to update the Real DOM.

  - **Update the Real DOM:** Finally, React applies these changes to the Real DOM, which results in the updated UI that users see.

- **Benefits of the Virtual DOM:**

  - **Performance:** The Virtual DOM minimizes direct manipulation of the Real DOM, reducing the number of updates and interactions with the browser, which can be slow and resource-intensive.

  - **Efficiency:** React's Virtual DOM algorithm is optimized for making the smallest number of changes needed to update the UI. This efficiency improves the application's overall performance.

  - **Cross-Platform:** The Virtual DOM makes it easier to render React components not only in web browsers but also on other platforms, such as mobile devices and server-side rendering.

- **Developer-Friendly:**

  - **Declarative Approach:** React allows developers to describe the UI in a declarative way, specifying how the UI should look based on the current application state. This makes it easier to reason about UI components.

  - **Component-Based:** React encourages a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable and composable components. Each component can manage its own state, making it easier to maintain and test.

In summary, the Virtual DOM is a crucial part of React's design, helping to improve the performance and developer experience when building web applications. It achieves this by efficiently updating the Real DOM based on changes in application state, allowing developers to work with a declarative and component-based approach to building user interfaces.

## React Hooks

React Hooks are **functions** that let you **_hook into_** _React state and lifecycle features from functional components_. They were introduced in _React 16.8_ to allow functional components to manage local component state, perform side effects, and access other React features without needing to write a class component.

Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know and love, such as state, lifecycle, context, refs, and more. Below are some of the most commonly used React Hooks with elaborations:

## useState Hook in React

`useState` is one of the most commonly used React Hooks, and it _allows functional components to manage local component state_. It was introduced in React 16.8 to provide state management capabilities to functional components, which previously could not manage state without using class components.

In simple words, the useState hook in React is like a magical container that holds and manages a piece of information, _typically a variable_, for your website or app. Imagine you have a counter on your webpage, and you want to keep track of its value. You can use useState to create and manage that counter.

### Here's how `useState` works:

- **Importing `useState`:** To use the `useState` Hook, you need to import it from the **react** library.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

- **Declaring State:** Inside your functional component, you can declare state variables using the `useState` Hook. It takes one argument, which is the initial state value.

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- **`state`:** This **variable** holds the current state value.
- **`setState`:** This is a function that allows you to update the state.

- **Example Usage:**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment 'count'
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Update the state using setCount
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useState` is used to manage the count state variable. Initially, `count` is set to `0`. When the **Increment** button is clicked, the `increment` function is called, and it uses `setCount` to update the `count` state. React will then re-render the component with the updated state.

The `useState` Hook is an essential tool for managing component-specific state in functional components. You can use it to manage multiple state variables in a single component, and each state variable is independent of the others.

## useEffect Hook in React

`useEffect` is a React Hook that enables you to perform side effects in functional components. _Side effects can include data fetching, interacting with the DOM, setting up subscriptions, and more_. `useEffect` is a critical tool for handling tasks that would typically be performed in lifecycle methods of class components.

In simpler terms, think of `useEffect` as a way to:

- Do something after the component is shown on the screen for the first time (like fetching data from a server).

- Redo that something when certain values you care about change (like re-fetching data when a user selects a different option).

- Clean up anything you set up when the component is no longer needed (like cancelling a timer or closing a connection).

It's a versatile tool that helps you manage the extra stuff your component needs to do beyond rendering UI elements.

### Here's an overview of how `useEffect` works and its key concepts:

- **Importing `useEffect`:** To use the `useEffect` Hook, you need to import it from the 'react' library.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
```

- **Declaring Side Effects:** You can _declare side effects by passing a function to `useEffect`_. This function will be executed after the component renders and the DOM is updated.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform side effects here
});
```

- **Dependencies Array:** You can also provide a _second argument_ to useEffect, which is an **_array of dependencies_**. This array specifies values (usually props or state variables) that the effect depends on. _The effect will only be re-run if one of these dependencies changes between renders_.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform side effects that depend on specific props or state
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

- **Cleanup:** If your effect **returns** a function, _React will treat it as a cleanup function_. This _function will be executed when the component is_ **unmounted** or _before the effect runs again_. This is useful for cleaning up resources such as subscriptions or event listeners.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform side effects here

  // Cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Clean up any resources
  };
});

// Note: The cleanup function won't run on the initial render.
```

### Here are some common use cases for `useEffect`:

- **Data Fetching:** You can use `useEffect` to _fetch data from an API_ and update the component's state with the fetched data.

- **DOM Manipulation:** Perform DOM operations like focusing an input field or updating the document title based on component state.

- **Subscriptions:** Set up and tear down subscriptions to external data sources (e.g., web sockets) when the component **mounts** and **unmounts**.

- **Timers and Intervals:** Start and stop timers or intervals for animations or periodic data updates.

Here's an example that demonstrates fetching data with `useEffect`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetchingExample() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data from an API
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((result) => {
        // Update the state with the fetched data
        setData(result);
      });
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means the effect runs once on mount

  return <div>{data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}</div>;
}
```

In this example, the `useEffect` Hook fetches data when the component mounts (because the dependency array is empty), and the fetched data is stored in the component's state. This is a common pattern for data fetching with `useEffect`.

## useContext Hook in React

The `useContext` Hook allows you to access the data or values stored in a React context from within a functional component. Context provides _a way to share data or functionality across the component tree without having to pass props explicitly at every level_.

In simple words, the `useContext` hook in React is _like a messenger that allows different parts of your React application to communicate and share data without having to pass it through each component manually_. It's like having a global storage area for information that multiple components can access.

Imagine you have some information (like a user's login status) that multiple parts of your app need to know about. Instead of passing this information down from parent components to child components one by one, you can use the useContext hook. It provides a way for any component to directly access and use this shared information without the need for prop drilling (passing data through many layers of components). It simplifies how components get access to common data, making your code cleaner and more efficient.

### Here's how `useContext` works:

- **Importing `useContext`:** You need to import the `useContext` Hook from the react library.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";
```

- **Accessing Context:** You can use `useContext` with a specific context object to access its value.

```javascript
const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
```

`MyContext` should be replaced with the actual context you want to consume.

- **Using the Context Value:** Once you've obtained the context value, you can use it within your component to access shared data or functionality.

Here's an example of how to use `useContext`:

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";

// Create a context
const MyContext = React.createContext();

function ParentComponent() {
  // Provide a value to the context
  const contextValue = "Hello from Context!";

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  // Consume the context value using useContext
  const valueFromContext = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Value from Context: {valueFromContext}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `ParentComponent` provides a value to the `MyContext` context using the `Provider`, and `ChildComponent` consumes that value using `useContext`. This allows `ChildComponent` to access the context value without the need for prop drilling.

While `useContext` is commonly used for consuming context, it's not the only context-related Hook. Other context-related Hooks include `useReducer` and `useRef` when used in combination with context to manage more complex state and actions in context providers.

## useRef Hook in React

The `useRef` Hook in React is a _way to create a mutable object that can hold a reference to a DOM element or any other value that needs to persist between renders without causing re-renders_. It's often used for accessing and interacting with DOM elements directly, managing focus, creating timers/intervals, and caching values.

### Here's how you can use the `useRef` Hook:

- **Importing `useRef`:** To use `useRef`, you need to import it from the **react** library.

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from "react";
```

- **Creating a Ref:** You can create a ref by calling `useRef()` and assigning it to a variable.

```javascript
const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
```

> `initialValue` is optional. You can provide an initial value to the ref, but it's typically used for storing the initial value of a DOM element (e.g., an input's initial value) rather than a general value.

- **Accessing the Current Value:** The `current` property of the ref object holds the current value. You can read and update this property as needed.

```javascript
const element = myRef.current;
```

> You can also assign a new value to `current`, but doing so won't trigger a re-render of the component.

### Here are some common use cases for the `useRef` Hook:

- **Accessing DOM Elements:** You can use `useRef` to obtain a reference to a DOM element and interact with it directly, like focusing an input field or measuring its dimensions.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus the input element when the component mounts
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

- **Storing Previous Values:** You can use `useRef` to store previous values, allowing you to compare them with new values in the `useEffect` Hook to detect changes.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent(props) {
  const prevPropsRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    prevPropsRef.current = props;
    // Compare prevPropsRef.current with props to detect changes
  });

  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
}
```

- **Caching Values:** You can cache values that should not trigger re-renders but need to persist between renders.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const expensiveValue = computeExpensiveValue();
  const cachedValueRef = useRef(expensiveValue);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Use cachedValueRef.current instead of recomputing
    const result = someFunction(cachedValueRef.current);
  }, []);

  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
}
```

The `useRef` Hook is a powerful tool for managing values and interacting with the DOM in React components while avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
