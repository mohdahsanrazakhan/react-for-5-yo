## What is React?

- React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications
- Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta)
- React is widely used to create interactive and dynamic web applications

### Here's a simplified breakdown: (optional)

- **Open-source** refers to software or projects where the original creators provide the underlying _code and resources for anyone to view, use, modify, and share freely_.<br>
  It's like sharing a recipe for a dish you've created, allowing others to see how it's made, make improvements, and share their versions without any restrictions. Open-source fosters collaboration and innovation by making knowledge and tools accessible to a wide community of people.

- **JavaScript library** is like a _collection of pre-written code_ that helps web developers do common tasks more easily and quickly when building websites or web applications.<br>
  It's like having a toolbox full of tools that you can use instead of having to create each tool from scratch.<br>
  These libraries provide ready-made functions and features, saving time and effort in coding, and making it easier to create interactive and dynamic websites.

- **User Interface (UI)** is like the _"face" of a computer program or a digital device_. It's what you see and interact with on your screen when you use software or apps.<br>
  UI design focuses on making this interaction as user-friendly and easy to understand as possible. It includes things like buttons, menus, icons, and how information is displayed, all aimed at making your experience pleasant and efficient when using technology.<br>
  Essentially, it's the bridge that allows you to communicate and control the digital world with your clicks, taps, and gestures.

- **Web Application** is like a _software program that you can use through a web browser_, just like how you use websites. It's a tool or service that helps you do things on the internet, like checking your email, shopping online, or using social media.<br>
  Unlike regular websites that mostly provide information, web applications allow you to interact with them, input data, and get specific results or perform tasks online, making them more like digital tools than just pages to read.
